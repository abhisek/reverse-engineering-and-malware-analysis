# MD5 Hash of Code Section

## Description

An executable file is provided as input. The task is to compute MD5 checksum of only the code section of the input file.

## Solution

A [Portable Executable](#) file is organized in terms of multiple sections. As a convention, most compilers use *.text* as the name for the text section in a PE file. It is possible to view and dump the contents of only *.text* section using [CFF Explorer Suite][1].

Once the contents of the *.text* section is dumped to file, it is possible to compute the MD5 checksum of the content using [WinMD5][2] tool or any other appropriate checksum computation tool:
